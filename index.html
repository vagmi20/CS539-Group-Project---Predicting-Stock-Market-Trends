        <h2>Project Motivation</h2>
        <p>We wanted to determine if we could use a combination of past stock data with the overall sentiment in the news for a company to determine whether the company's stock will increase or decrease. This will help investors observe how the news may impact the performance of a particular company's stock.</p>

        <h2>Data</h2>
        <h3>Stock Data</h3>
        <p>We fetch the last 2 years (2022-01-03 to 2023-12-29) of stock data specifically for APPLE, NVIDIA, and META. Yahoo Finance is used to retrieve stock data for all companies. For stock features, we use the Adjusted Close Price, Open, High, Low, Close Price, and Volume.</p>

        <h3>News Data</h3>
        <p>For gathering the news data, we used Google News to query relevant articles from the Google News database. We use both the stock ticker name and the full name of each company as search words. Since NewsAPI is limited and can only provide brief sentences from the articles, we manually webscrape the data by querying the links instead and using BeautifulSoup + URLLib3 to parse the html into text. For parsing only relevant information within each article, we grab text from only <p> and <title> tags in the webpage html. </title></p>

        <h3>Sentiment Data</h3>
        <p>To obtain the sentiment for each article for a single company, we feed the scraped content (including the title) of each article into a sentiment analysis model. For the model, we use a distilled version of <a href="https://huggingface.co/mrm8488/distilroberta-finetuned-financial-news-sentiment-analysis">RoBERTa-base-model</a> pretrained on the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/financial_phrasebank">financial_phrasebank</a> dataset. Pretraining on financial phrases will improve the ability of the sentiment model to capture valuable information from words within the financial vernacular. Furthermore, financial words will have more weight in the final sentiment analysis.</p>

      </ul>
    
    
        <h3>Feature Engineering</h3>
        <p>We combine our 7 stock features mentioned in the Stock Data section with 6 crafted sentiment features. For our 6 sentiment features, we use the number of articles and the mean probability by sentiment class (negative, neutral, positive). Note that because stock data is not available for all days in the past 2 years (due to days where market was closed), sentiment for certain days are removed. This allows perfect joins over the data tables to occur. Our list of final features is as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Adj Close</li>
          <li>Close</li>
          <li>High</li>
          <li>Low</li>
          <li>Open</li>
          <li>Volume</li>
          <li>mean_neg_sentiment_prob</li>
          <li>mean_neu_sentiment_prob</li>
          <li>mean_pos_sentiment_prob</li>
          <li>neg_sentiment_cnt</li>
          <li>neu_sentiment_cnt</li>
          <li>pos_sentiment_cnt</li>
      </ul>
      
        </p> To generate target labels for our data, we compare the next day's adjusted close price to prior day's price and assign label of 1 (Uptrend) if it's greater; else 0 (Downtrend).</p>

        <h3>Training and Inference</h3>
        <p>We preprocess our data for training by standardizing features via removal of the mean and scaling to unit variance. For performing the train-test split, it's important to note that using SKLearn's built-in function is not advisable because it randomly splits the data. Due to the time-series aspect of the data, the train-test split is done sequentially by using the last 97 days (~20% of data) of stock data as the test. The first 391 days are used for training. After performing the train-test split, we get 198 samples for the Uptrend class and 193 samples for the Downtrend class. The overall train set is quite balanced. The testing set consists of 56 Uptrend and 41 Downtrend samples.</p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>We ran 8 machine learning models to determine which one was able to predict if a company was going to have an upward or downward trend in their stocks with the best accuracy. The accuracies for these models change based on the company we are looking at. Below we give a preview of the accuracy metrics as well as the confusion matrix specifically for NVIDIA.</p>

        <h2>Effect of Sentiment Features</h2>
        <p>We perform a small experiment with the Decision Tree classifier to understand how much the sentiment features make a difference when predicting stock trends. We perform prediction on the test data with and without sentiment features for comparison.</p>
        <h3>Without Sentiment Features</h3>
        <div class="no-sentiment-results">
            <img src="nosent.png" alt="nosent Results" class="no-sent-results-img">
            <img src="nosent_cft.png" alt="nosent Confusion Matrix" class="no-sent-matrix-img">
        </div>
        <h3>With Sentiment Features</h3>
        <div class="sentiment-results">
            <img src="sent.png" alt="sent Results" class="sent-results-img">
            <img src="sent_cft.png" alt="sent Confusion Matrix" class="sent-matrix-img">
        </div>
        <p>We find that sentiment does signifcantly improve stock trend prediction and improves accuracy by ~9%. The Decision Tree model trained without sentiment features seems to gain heavy bias towards predicting the Downtrend class while the model with sentiment features has less overall bias.</p>
